# app.py and necessary tools to execute it

In this folder named App, we have the code that we use to create the app.

To execute the app we need a model, and some important files, so is necessary to run the code (main script Mushrooms_Classification.ipynb) and use the dataset placed in the repo, you can scrape your mushrooms as we explained in the main README.md but the results could be different. If you want to run the app without run the code, the model created with that dataset and with 60 - 65 % accuracy is the model placed in this folder "model_mushrooms_SGD", also a csv with mushrooms_labels is neccesary, and of course the ngrok tunnel as we did in the script to get the public url.
